## 1. Overview

**DailyVision** is an Edge AI-powered assistive vision system designed to support users in a wide range of daily activities by recognizing visual cues in their environment, extracting relevant text, and providing real-time voice feedback. Whether navigating busy streets, identifying building entrances, reading public notices, or interpreting directional signs in unfamiliar areas, DailyVision acts as a smart visual assistant.

The system integrates advanced technologies such as Object detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and offline text-to-speech (TTS) to deliver fast assistance.


## 2. Features
- üîç **YOLOv8 Object Detection** for identifying objects.
- üßæ **EasyOCR** for extracting text from detected regions  
- üó£Ô∏è **Text-to-Speech** using `pyttsx3` for offline voice feedback  
- üñºÔ∏è **Annotated image** output with bounding boxes and labels  

# 3. Environment Setup

üß™ To set up the Python environment required for running the application, follow the steps below. This ensures all dependencies are installed in an isolated and reproducible environment.

## üì¶ 3.1 Miniconda Installation
