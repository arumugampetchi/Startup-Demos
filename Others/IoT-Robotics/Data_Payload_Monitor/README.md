# 1. Overview

This application is designed to monitor and analyze data payloads in real-time, providing valuable insights into system performance and health. The intention of this application is to enable efficient data management, reduce errors, and improve overall system reliability by providing a centralized platform for data monitoring and analysis.

A distributed system for real-time sensor data simulation, processing, and visualization using Python and Streamlit. This project is designed to simulate sensor data, process it on an edge device, and visualize it on a remote dashboard.

## üéØ System Overview

This application consists of **three independent components**, each running on a separate device within the **same local network**:

1. **Sensor Simulation (PC)**
   Simulates real-time sensor data (Heart Rate, SpO‚ÇÇ, Body Temperature) and sends it over TCP.

2. **Data Processing Server (RB3 / Edge Device)**  
   Receives sensor data, processes it (e.g., adds health status), and forwards it to the dashboard.

3. **Dashboard Application (PC)**
   Visualizes incoming data in real-time using Streamlit, with charts, status indicators, and historical tracking.

## üß† User Intention

This setup is ideal for:
- Demonstrating real-time IoT data flow
- Monitoring health metrics in a simulated environment
- Testing edge processing and visualization pipelines
- Educational or demo purposes in AI, IoT, or healthcare tech
